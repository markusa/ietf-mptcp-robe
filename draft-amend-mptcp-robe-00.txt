        Multipath TCP extension for Robust Session Establishment
                       draft-amend-mptcp-robe-00

Abstract

   Multipath TCP extends the plain, singlepath limited, TCP towards the
   capability of multipath transmission.  This greatly improves the
   reliability and performance of TCP communication.  For backwards
   compatiblity reason the Multipath TCP was designed to setup
   successfully an inital path first, after which subsequent paths can
   be added for multipath transmission.  For that reason the Multipath
   TCP has the same limitations as the plain TCP during connection
   setup, in case the selected path is not functional.

   RobE provides the ability to simultaneously use multiple paths for
   connection setup.  This document presents with RobE a set of
   extensions to Multipath TCP to overcome its singlepath limitation
   during connection initialisation and extends it to a full fledged
   multipath protocol.  RobE ensures connecitivity if at least one
   functional path out of a bunch of paths is given and offers beside
   that the opportunity to significantly improve loading times of
   Internet services.

1.  Introduction

   Multipath TCP Robust session Establishment (MPTCP RobE) is a set of
   extensions to regular MPTCP [RFC6824] and its next upcoming version
   [I-D.ietf-mptcp-rfc6824bis], which releases single path limitations
   during the initial connection setup.  Several scenarios requires and
   benefit from a reliable and in time connection setup which is not
   covered by [RFC6824] and [I-D.ietf-mptcp-rfc6824bis] so far.  MPTCP
   was designed to be compliant with the TCP standard [RFC0793] and
   introduced therefore the concept of an inital TCP flow and adding
   subsequent flows after sucessfull multipath negotiation on the
   initial path.  While fulfilling its purpose, MPTCP is however fully

   dependent on the transmission characteristics of the communication
   link selected for initiating MPTCP.

   RobE aims to overcomes the limitations of [RFC6824] and
   [I-D.ietf-mptcp-rfc6824bis] using one initial flow and introduces the
   concept of potential initial flows triggered simultaneously.
   Potential initial flows gives the freedom to use more than one path
   to request multipath connectivity and select the initial flow at a
   later point.  Potential initial flow mechanisms and the gain of
   robustness and performance over the traditional MPTCP connection
   setup are evaluated in [RobE_slides] and [RobE_paper].

   Two mechanisms of RobE, a simple and an extended version are
   specified in this document and are further referred to as RobE_SIM
   and RobE_EXT.  RobE_SIM is a break-before-make mechanism,
   guaranteeing at least the robust connection establishment, however
   the RobE_EXT reuses every potential inital flow request to combine it
   with less overhaed and accelerated multipath availability, leveraging
   a new MPTCP option MP_JOIN_CAP.  From a standardization perspective,
   the RobE_SIM is fully compliant with [RFC6824] and
   [I-D.ietf-mptcp-rfc6824bis] and is herein more of a descriptive and
   procedurale nature.  The RobE_EXT requires a new MPTCP option but
   with the potential to significantly improve the MPTCP experience.

   Table 1 summarizes the impact of RobE_SIM and RobE_EXT compared to
   [RFC6824] and [I-D.ietf-mptcp-rfc6824bis].  Considered are the
   scenarios where the initial path (IP) is disturbed and the impact on
   connection setup duration for the IP and multipath (MP) availability.
   In particular both setup durations are a mean to significantly
   improve the quality of experience.

   This document presents the protocol, procedures and changes required
   to extend MPTCP by a robust session setup; specifically, those for
   signaling and setting up multiple paths ("subflows")

1.1.  Terminology

   This document makes use of a number of terms that are either MPTCP-
   specific or have defined meaning in the context of MPTCP, as follows:

      Path: A sequence of links between a sender and a receiver, defined
      in this context by a 4-tuple of source and destination address/
      port pairs.

      Subflow: A flow of TCP segments operating over an individual path,
      which forms part of a larger MPTCP connection.  A subflow is
      started and terminated similar to a regular TCP connection.

1.3.  Simple RobE (RobE_SIM)

   Sender only implementation, no negotiation required, robust according
   to Table 1, connection setup benefits from fastest path

1.4.  Extended RobE (RobE_EXT)

   Extends RobE_SIM by reusing the potential initial flows.  This
   eliminates the overhead from RobE_SIM and accelerate the transmission
   speed by early availablity of multiple paths.  Further it relaxes the
